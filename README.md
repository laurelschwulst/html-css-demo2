# Demo 2 — Multi-Page Site with Big Buttons

A simple, multi-page HTML & CSS website that uses generously sized links ("buttons") to navigate to subpages. Good for a portfolio or simple site with multiple pieces of content that should be separated.

The form is inspired by https://shannonfinnegan.com.

The content is by Laurel Schwulst (me), acting as an on-ramp to thinking about how to publish on the web. No matter how we create it — "The purpose of a website is to exist!" — first and foremost, so let's decide the best way based on our needs.

Created by [Laurel Schwulst](https://laurelschwulst.com) for a workshop with the British Art Network, May 2024.
