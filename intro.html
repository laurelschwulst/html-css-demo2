            In this workshop, I'm going to show you how to use HTML and CSS, which is just one way to build websites. (Feel free to learn JS on your own.)

           What’s cool about HTML & CSS is that these are the building blocks of the web no matter what. You can “view source” on any website and see it boils down to HTML & CSS generally speaking, no matter if you made it in SquareSpace, Wordpress, or any other website builder.
